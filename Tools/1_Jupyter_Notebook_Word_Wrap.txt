In Jupyter Notebook, you can enable text wrapping for cells containing long lines of text by setting the appropriate CSS style. Here's how you can enable word wrapping for text in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

1. **Create a Markdown Cell:**
   First, create a Markdown cell where you want to enable word wrapping. To do this, select a cell and change its type to Markdown. You can do this by selecting the cell and choosing "Markdown" from the dropdown menu in the toolbar or by pressing `Esc` to enter command mode and then pressing `M` to convert the cell to Markdown.

2. **Use HTML `<div>` Tag:**
   Within the Markdown cell, use an HTML `<div>` tag to apply a CSS style to the text. You can set the `overflow-wrap` CSS property to `break-word` to enable word wrapping. Here's an example of how you can use it:

   ```markdown
   <div style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">
   This is a long line of text that will wrap to the next line if it exceeds the width of the cell.
   </div>
   ```

   In the above example, the `style` attribute sets the `overflow-wrap` property to `break-word`, allowing long words to break and wrap onto the next line.

3. **Run the Cell:**
   After adding the HTML code to the Markdown cell, run the cell to render the formatted text. The long lines of text will now be wrapped within the cell.

Remember that this method uses HTML and CSS to style the text in a Markdown cell. By using this approach, you can control the word wrapping behavior for specific cells in your Jupyter Notebook.
