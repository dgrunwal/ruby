In Ruby, variable names are used to store data values. Variable names in Ruby are unique because they don't have to be declared with a specific data type and can dynamically change their type during runtime.


Additionally, Ruby variable names are case-sensitive, allowing distinct differentiation between variables with different capitalizations, making them unique within the Ruby context. Ruby's flexibility in naming conventions and dynamic typing contribute to the unique nature of variable names in the language.
