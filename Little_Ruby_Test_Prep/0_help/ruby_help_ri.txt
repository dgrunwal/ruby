In Ruby, you can access help documentation for a specific method or class using the `ri` (Ruby Interactive) command-line tool. Here are a few examples of how to use `ri`:

1. **To get help for a specific class:**
   ```
   ri ClassName
   ```

   For example:
   ```
   ri Array
   ```

2. **To get help for a specific method of a class:**
   ```
   ri ClassName.method_name
   ```

   For example:
   ```
   ri Array.each
   ```

3. **To get general help for Ruby programming:**
   ```
   ri

C:\Ruby32\bin>ri

Enter the method name you want to look up.

   ```

   This will provide a list of available topics. You can then type the topic you are interested in to get more detailed information.

Make sure you have Ruby and its documentation installed on your system to use the `ri` tool. Some systems might require additional setup for `ri` to work correctly.
