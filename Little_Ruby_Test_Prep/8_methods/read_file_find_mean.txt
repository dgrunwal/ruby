The error in your code is because `numbers.txt` should be a string literal to represent the filename, but it's being treated as a variable or method name `numbers`. To fix this, you need to enclose `numbers.txt` in quotes to make it a string. Here's the corrected code:

```ruby
def mean_from_file(filename)
  # Read integers from the file
  integers = File.readlines(filename).map(&:to_i)

  # Calculate the mean
  total = integers.inject(0) { |sum, x| sum += x }
  mean = total / integers.size.to_f

  # Return the mean
  mean
end

mean = mean_from_file("numbers.txt")
puts mean
```

Make sure to place `numbers.txt` in the same directory as your Ruby script, or provide the full path if it's located elsewhere. After making this change, you should be able to run the code without errors.


CALCULATE NUMBERS IN ROWS SEPARATED BY COMMAS


If the numbers in the `numbers.txt` file are separated by commas (`,`) within each row, you need to adjust your code to split each row into individual numbers before converting them to integers. Here's how you can modify the `mean_from_file` method to handle this:

```ruby
def mean_from_file(filename)
  # Read lines from the file and split each line into individual numbers
  numbers = File.readlines(filename).map { |line| line.split(',').map(&:to_i) }

  # Flatten the array of arrays to get a single array of numbers
  integers = numbers.flatten

  # Calculate the mean
  total = integers.inject(0) { |sum, x| sum += x }
  mean = total / integers.size.to_f

  # Return the mean
  mean
end

mean = mean_from_file("numbers.txt")
puts mean
```

In this modified version, `File.readlines(filename)` reads each line of the file into an array of strings. Then, `map { |line| line.split(',').map(&:to_i) }` splits each line by commas (`','`) to create arrays of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(&:to_i)`. Finally, `flatten` is called on the `numbers` array to flatten it into a single array of integers. The rest of the code remains the same as before.
